digits-logreg.py 
===========

Performs one-versus-all regularized logistic regression to recognize hand-written digits. The data set corresponds to Problem Set #3 of Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning Class.

digits-nn.py 
===========

Uses a 3-layer neuronal network to recognize hand-written digits (data set same as above). 
Note: this code only implements the feed-forward propagation algorithm using already learned weights. Code for learning weights coming soon!
